					<h2 class="periodTitle">Early Life (1952-1962)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The video games that we all know and love actually started out in laboratories. The first “video game” was created in 1952 and was a simple tic-tac-toe game and was built to demonstrate the power of computers. Unfortunately, the game required a computer so large that it fit an entire room, so it couldn’t be sold. Other games were Tennis for Two and Spacewar! Which were invented in 1958 and 1962 respectively.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--The Beginning of Gaming (1972)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">The Beginning of Gaming (1972)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>This year contains two very important moments in Video Game history. Those two were the creation of a home console (a device that you could plug into your TV to play video games at home) by Ralph Baer and the creation of Atari (one of the first video game companies) by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney. This year also marked the creation of “Pong” which is sometimes regarded as the first video game to be invented.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--The Golden Age of Arcade Games (1970-1980)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">The Golden Age of Arcade Games (1970-1980)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Since Pong was such a success, many people and companies started creating their own arcade games. Some popular games are Space wars, Asteroids, and the legendary Pac-Man. This time was also when Nintendo started making an appearance with its own games, Donkey Kong and Mario Brothers. However, this golden age slowly came to an end as home consoles became more popular.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--The Video Game Crash (1983-1985)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">The Video Game Crash (1983-1985)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>During this time, the gaming industry faced a problem. Arcade games were slowly losing their popularity. With arcade games being “boring”, people started using home console games more. The problem with that was that most of the home console games were overhyped garbage. The fact that there were so many of those games caused many people to lose interest in video games.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--Nintendo to the Rescue (1985)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">Nintendo to the Rescue (1985)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Nintendo helped bring back the video game industry with their invention of the NES. The NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) was a home console that made use of game cartridges to contain video games. It had many different extensions like a light gun and a microphone. This system introduced many of Nintendo’s popular games to the home environment like Super Mario Bros. and the Legend of Zelda.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--Sega Puts Up a Fight (1989)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">Sega Puts Up a Fight (1989)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>With the success of the NES, Sega sought to earn a profit as well. With some marketing, technological innovation, and the release of some successful games, Sega beat Nintendo is the video game race. In response, Nintendo released the Super NES (SNES) in 1991. For the next few years, Sega and Nintendo had a small rivalry which ended with Sega being the more popular console in the international stage but Nintendo retaining its popularity in Japan.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--Sony and the PlayStation (1995)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">Sony and the PlayStation (1995)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>In 1985, Sony started their video game journey with the creation of the PlayStation. While starting out by losing to Sega in terms of sales, Sony still ended up on top because of the PlayStation’s advanced technology and the abundance of third-party games (games created by another company) at their disposal.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--Travelling Through the Third Dimensions (1995)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">Travelling Through the Third Dimensions (1995)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>During 1995, another huge leap in the video game industry happened. It was during this time that 3d games were introduced to the market. Many companies started releasing their own 3d games. Examples are Nintendo’s Super Mario 64, Sega’s Virtua Fighter, and Sony’s Metal Gear Solid.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--A Shift in Power (1995-2001)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">A Shift in Power (1995-2001)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>During this time, many aspects of video gaming changed. For one thing, Nintendo released the Nintendo 64 in 1996 which was a lot faster than the older models. A few years later, Sony released the PlayStation 2 which was also a revolutionary development in the video game industry. Unfortunately, Sega ran into some difficulties and so completely stopped developing game consoles in 2001. In that same year, Microsoft started making a move by introducing the Xbox to the market.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--Advanced Consoles and Mobile Gaming (2006-2012)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">Advanced Consoles and Mobile Gaming (2006-2012)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360 were introduced in 2006. These three consoles were the next step to the video game industry today. For example, the Wii introduced motion gameplay which allowed players to control the players with their own movements. This was also the time mobile game started becoming popular. Some popular examples are Angry Birds, Plants Vs. Zombies, and Jetpack Joyride.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--The Rise of the Toys-to-Life Genre (2012-2016)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">The Rise of the Toys-to-Life Genre (2012-2016)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>What exactly is the toys-to-life genre? Basically, a person has to buy real life figures of objects or characters and then they can place them in the game by attaching the figures to some kind of extension. The player would then be able to play with those characters in the game. This Genre was incredibly popular during the time, but it quickly lost its popularity due to how expensive getting every single add-on in the game could be.</p>

				<article class="timePeriodCard">	<!--The Present (2012 - Present)-->
					<h2 class="periodTitle">The Present (2012 - Present)</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>The PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch are some of the most well-known gaming consoles in the world and are still being use today. Especially with the pandemic of 2020 (which is still going on while I was writing this), video games have become a huge part of society. The technology used in video games is so advanced that the graphics of some games look like they were taken from reality and the processing speed of some games can load gigantic maps in a few seconds. Video games can be their own movies at this point. Video games have gone a long way from being a game of Tic-tac-toe that could fit a whole room to an incredibly common piece of equipment. </p>
